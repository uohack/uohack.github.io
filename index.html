            <h2>Hello, world!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to UOHack. The main goal of this meetup is to provide an inclusive, collaborative space where you, as a student, can learn about and discuss web development and programming as they relate to media.</p>
            <p>Once a week, during the school year, experienced professionals volunteer their time to help you with your projects. From time to time, we teach specific topics, but we've found that time is best spent working toward tangible goals. Of course, we don't have all the answers, but we'll work with you to figure it out.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, we're interested in teaching you the real-world skills that will prepare you for a career in journalism or advertising.</p>
            <p>If you're interested in learning more, follow us on <a href="https://twitter.com/uohack">Twitter</a> for meetup locations and times. Have some questions? Send us an <a href="mailto:hack@uohack.com">email</a> and we'll get back to you as soon as we can. You can also check out what we've done in the past on <a href="https://github.com/uohack">Github</a>. We've even included a few helpful examples below:</p>
