### Getting started

- GitHub
  - [Sign up for GitHub](https://github.com/) 
  - (I recommend making your usename your first and last name, all downcase. Mine is 'ivarvong')
  - Confirm the GitHub email

- Request to join [the private Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/576874269016205/)

- Our hashtag is ***#uohack*** on Instagram and [Twitter](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23uohack&src=typd&f=realtime)

### Make your first web page 

- Create a new GitHub repo with the "+" button in the top-right corner. 
- The repo name will be your usename, followed by .github.io. 
- For example, mine would be ivarvong.github.io
- Press "Create"
- Create a new file in your new repo with the little blue "+".
- Name it "index.html" (no capatials, no spaces, must be exactly that)
- Type something simple like "Hello, world!" into the text editor box
- Press "Commit"
- You're done!

Now, navigate to http://yourusername.github.io and you should see your work live on the internet! [Here's mine](http://ivarvong.github.io).
